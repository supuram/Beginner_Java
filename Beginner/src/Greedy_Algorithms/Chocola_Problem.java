We are given a bar of chocolate composed of m X n square pieces. One should break the chocolate into
single squares. Each break of a part of the chocolate is charged a cost expressed by a positive integer.
This cost does not depend on the size of the part that is being broken but only depends on the line the
break goes along. Let us denote the costs of breaking along consecutive vertical lines with x1, x2, ...,
x(m-1) and along horizontal lines with y1, y2, ..., y(n-1). Compute the whole cost of breaking the whole
chocolate into single squares.
